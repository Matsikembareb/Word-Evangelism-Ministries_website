            Come as you are to Jesus Christ. He knows you more than 
            you know yourself as He is your father and He loves you so much.
            He is ever ready to forgive and wash you clean, He died for you,
            when you accept Him as Lord and Savior He will become 
            your righteousness.</blockquote>
